# Object Detection,  Django Web App

The project consists of object detection, object segmentation, and chat PDF AI created using Deep Learning. The YOLOv8 model was used for the Detection and Segmentation sections, while the Together LLaMA-70b model was used for the chat PDF AI section. To make the project work, you need to:

- Download the required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.

- You should provide training for object detection and object segmentation in YOLOv8 and save the `best.pt` file.

- You should upload the saved `best.pt` file to the main directory of the project. Afterward, you need to enter the file path in the specified locations in the `objection.py` and `segmentation.py` files.

-You need to obtain an API key from Together for Chat PDF AI. You should then write the relevant key in the specified location in the `chat.py` file.
